        Greetings Earthling, Alien, or Interdimensional Being! Welcome to FoodFuture&apos;s Privacy
        Policy page, the one place in the universe where we get serious (but still manage to squeeze
        in a few jokes). Here&apos;s the low-down on how we protect your earthly (and otherworldly)
        data:
      </p>
      <ol className="list-decimal pl-10">

          <p className="mt-2">
            <b>Information We Collect:</b> We gather some basic information from you when you sign
            up, like your name, email, and delivery address. Don&apos;t worry, we won&apos;t ask for
            your DNA sequence or secret superhero identity.
          </p>
        </li>

            <b>How We Use Your Information:</b> We use your data to personalize your experience,
            process your orders, and send you updates about our service. We might also analyze your
            food choices to make our offerings tastier, but we won&apos;t judge if you order pizza
            five nights in a row.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Sharing Your Information:</b> We share your information only as necessary with our
            partners to get your food to you. We won&apos;t beam your data to extraterrestrial
            beings or anyone who&apos;s not directly involved in getting your food from our
            teleportation ovens to your plate.

            <b>Cookies:</b> Yes, we use cookies on our site. Not the chocolate-chip kind, the
            internet kind. They help us understand how you use our site and make your experience
            smoother than a space ride in zero gravity.

            <b>Data Protection:</b> We have more safeguards than a spaceship&apos;s control room to
            keep your data safe. Think of us as the galactic guardians of your privacy.

            <b>Your Rights:</b> You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data
            at any time. Just drop us a line and we&apos;ll help you out. If you&apos;d like to
            delete your data, it&apos;ll be as though you never existed...in our system, at least.

            <b>Changes to Privacy Policy:</b> This policy may change faster than the theory of the
            expanding universe. When we update it, we&apos;ll let you know so you&apos;re always in
            the loop.

            Reach out to us. We&apos;re always here to help and laugh.

          and this page wasn&apos;t required. I just thought it would be fun to add. If you&apos;re
          still somehow reading this, I hope you have a great day! :)
